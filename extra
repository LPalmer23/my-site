      <h2>CollegeCarpool</h2>
      <p>
        Every holiday break, students scramble to get home — overpriced trains, crowded buses, or flights that burn cash and carbon.
        After meeting countless BU students from NJ and NY, I thought: why not carpool?
        CollegeCarpool connects students heading the same way to cut costs, skip travel chaos, save some carbon, and make a friend on the way home for the holidays.
        With funding from BU’s iBUild Lab Seed Grant, we built this site.

      <h2>Vertical Aeroponics</h2>
      <p>
        Between 2017 and 2023, over $2 billion was poured into vertical farming startups—most of which collapsed by 2024.
        But while big ventures failed, small-scale models like <a href="https://greenbronxmachine.org/" target="_blank">Stephen Ritz’s Green Bronx Machine</a>
        were making a big impact—growing thousands of pounds of produce in Bronx classrooms.
        Inspired by that model, we’re studying the feasibility of operating this technology—tracking the exact energy and resource inputs—and modeling how small-scale aeroponics in pre-existing infrastructure could be scaled more widely to fight food insecurity and cut the carbon footprint of traditional, far-away agriculture.

      <h2>BU Energy Insights</h2>
      <p>
        While working with BU Facilities & Management, I learned about BU’s contract with ISO-NE and the importance of reducing peak-hour demand.
        When demand spikes, the grid turns to its dirtiest generators—coal and oil.
        I created a website that alerts building administrators ahead of predicted peaks and tracks whether energy-saving actions had a measurable impact.

      <h2>Kilachand Leadership</h2>
      <p>
        In an effort to give back to the Honors College community, I ran for Class Representative and Treasurer on the Kilachand Leadership Advisory Board.
        Our focus is on strengthening student connections and exposing peers to engaging, interdisciplinary opportunities—from city planning workshops to mock policy debates.
        I’m currently planning a student-led panel series showcasing students with diverse career paths to highlight the key lessons and steps that helped them land their dream internships and jobs.

      <h2>Harvard IT</h2>
      <p>
        During the school year, I work part-time as an IT User Assistant at Harvard.
        I’ve learned how to efficiently troubleshoot hybrid classrooms and provide clear, effective support—helping ensure students can learn to their fullest potential without disruption.

      <h2>Tutoring & Mentorship</h2>
      <p>
        Tutoring has always been a meaningful part of my life. In high school, I joined YASH and LEAF to support younger students through reading and math.
        As a half Puerto Rican college student, I’m building a mentorship program connecting Spanish-speaking students with kids in Puerto Rico—offering academic support and encouragement in an education system well underfunded and often overlooked.

      <h2>Appalachia Service Project</h2>
      <p>
        One of my favorite volunteering experiences was with the Appalachia Service Project—a phenomenal organization that teaches students construction skills while offering free home repairs to low-income communities.
        I was lucky enough to visit West Virginia and help insulate an entire roof for a family living in a mobile home park.
